### Project Title
# Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
For this project, we will utilize Python to delve into bike share system data from three major U.S. citiesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Our tasks will involve coding to import this data and derive insightful insights by calculating descriptive statistics. 
### Files used
The python code is provided in the following file:
        bikeshare.py
    These files are excluded from being uploaded to the remote repository using the .gitignore file due to their large size:
        chicago.csv
        new_york_city.csv
        washington.csv
